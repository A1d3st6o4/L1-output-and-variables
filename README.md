## Python 
python- an OBJECT-ORIENTED language

## output
Output- The way the computer prints informartion to the user in the "console"

To output we use `print()`

## Comments
Comments- Notes that the computer skips over, 

To comment use `#COMMENT` for single line 

We use `'''COMMENT'''` for block commands

## Data Types
We will be working on 5 different data types

1. Integer (int) - Whole numbers
2. Character (char) - a single letter/symbol/number
3. String (str) - collection of characters
4. Floating point (float) - Decimal numbers
5. Boolean (bool) - True(1)/ False(0)


   ## Variables

 Variables - containers that hold a value
 ## Rules for variable names 

 1. Always start with a letter
    `1name = "Aiden" `--> NOT ALLOWED
2. Can only contain numbers, letters and underscores(_) `my name = "Celine" --> NOT ALLOWED

3. If more than one word, use camelcase or underscores to seperate words `myFirstName` or `my_First_Name`
